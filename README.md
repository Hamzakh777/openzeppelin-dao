Problems that DAOs have to deal with
====================================
- Proof of person-hood: We need to have one person equals to one vote. Currently this hasn't been solved as a single person can create multiple wallets
- Voting mechanisms: how do people actually vote? Using token? Using NFTs? How do we detect a bad decision from a good one?

Two types of voting
===================
- On chain: (Ex: Compound) Expensive. Governor C
- Off chain: You can actually sign a vote without sending it to the blockchain. Also you can replay all these side transactions into a single transaction to save gas

This project includes
====================
1. DAO smart contracts
2. Deployment scripts
3. Scripts to interact with the smart contracts
